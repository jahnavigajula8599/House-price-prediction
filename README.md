# House-price-prediction

The rental market is volatile, and the Rental prices are unstable and fluctuating.
This is because the prices are influenced by numerous factors like the price of land, Landmark, Demand of the area etc
In this project, I have decided to use various regression techniques to predict house rent based on these factors.
This dataset consists of 80 variables/features and 2919 rows. 
The ‘SalePrice’ attribute is our target variable.

Motivation :

● This price estimation is necessary during the sale of a property. 

● Also while applying for a loan or determining the property's marketability as well.

● But the problem is manual pricing calculation is challenging for both buyer and the vendor.

● As a result it's critical to establish a way to forecast house rents considering the influencing elements.

Main goals :
1. The main goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the house rent of homes based on 
distinct factors.
2. Minimize the difference between actual rent and the rent predicted by our model
